      <h1>The Inception of the Accord</h1>
      <p>Here is a quote from Honda:</p>
      <blockquote cite="https://automobiles.honda.com/accord">
        In 1976, the first Accord was introduced. For a humble hatchback, it was a runaway successâ€”winning over car buyers with its simple design and fuel-efficiency.
        It quickly became the best-selling car in America and continues to hold the honor, with over 13 million sold.
